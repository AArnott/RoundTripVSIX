RoundTripVSIX
=============

This project is an example of how to create a VSIX project file that can round trip between all currently released versions of Visual Studio.  It starts with a vanilla 2010 VSIX extension and then makes a small set of changes which allow it to be editted in 2012 and 2013.  This includes build + F5 support.
